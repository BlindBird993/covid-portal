The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal provides information, guidelines, tools and services to support researchers to utilise Swedish and European infrastructures for data sharing, in particular the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.org).

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is written and managed by the SciLifeLab Data Centre and partners. It is regularly updated with new services, tools and data. Suggestions, corrections or other comments are most welcome.

SciLifeLab is committed to the open sharing of data and results, and has signed the Wellcome Trust statement on [Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak](https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data).

##### About SciLifeLab

SciLifeLab, Science for Life Laboratory, is an institution for the advancement of molecular biosciences in Sweden. We are funded as a national research infrastructure by the Swedish government. 

Our organization leverages the unique strengths of individual researchers across Sweden into a focused resource for the life science community. We provide access for thousands of researchers to the cutting-edge instrumentation and deep scientific expertise necessary to be internationally competitive in bioscience research. This infrastructure is supported and developed by our research community, including internationally recognized experts in life science and technology. Our facilities and expertise create a unique environment for carrying out health and environmental research at the highest level.

SciLifeLab started out in 2010 as a joint effort between four universities: [Karolinska Institutet](https://www.ki.se/), [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/) and [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/). Today, we support research activities at all major Swedish universities.

##### Data at SciLifeLab

Life science research is increasingly becoming not only technology-driven, but also data-driven. SciLifeLab coordinates and supports activities throughout the life cycle of data, from project planning, data production, data analysis, data sharing, to publishing and reuse of data, where researchers are dependent on advanced data analysis and e-infrastructures. 

Our focus is on data arising from the use of SciLifeLab infrastructure platforms, both to promote research on adding value to data, research deriving biological knowledge from data, and infrastructure making data findable and available. At SciLifeLab, we see data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations and strive to make our data [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples), handled according to open science standards and that its long- term value to the scientific community is maximized.
