The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal provides information, guidelines, tools and services to support researchers to utilise Swedish and European infrastructures for data sharing, in particular the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.org). It is regularly updated with new services, tools and data. Suggestions, corrections or other comments are most welcome.

## What organisations are behind the portal?

The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is operated by the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data) and partners. The [Swedish Research Council](https://vr.se) is responsible for coordination with the European initiative. 

SciLifeLab and the Swedish Research Council are committed to the open sharing of data and results, and have both signed the Wellcome Trust statement on [Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak](https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data). 

### [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se)

SciLifeLab, Science for Life Laboratory, is an institution for the advancement of molecular biosciences in Sweden. We are funded as a national research infrastructure by the Swedish government. Our organization leverages the unique strengths of individual researchers across Sweden into a focused resource for the life science community. We provide access for thousands of researchers to the cutting-edge instrumentation and deep scientific expertise necessary to be internationally competitive in bioscience research. This infrastructure is supported and developed by our research community, including internationally recognized experts in life science and technology. Our facilities and expertise create a unique environment for carrying out health and environmental research at the highest level.

SciLifeLab started out in 2010 as a joint effort between four universities: Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University and Uppsala University. Today, we support research activities at all major Swedish universities.

### [National Bioinformatics Infrastructure](https://nbis.se)

NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) is a distributed national research infrastructure supported by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsr√•det), Science for Life Laboratory, all major Swedish universities and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, providing state-of-the-art bioinformatics to the Swedish life science researchers community. NBIS is also the Swedish contact point to the European infrastructure for biological information [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/).

### [Swedish National Data Service](https://snd.gu.se)

Swedish National Data Service has a primary function to support the accessibility, preservation, and re-use of research data and related materials. As a national infrastructure, SND coordinates a network of more than 30 universities and public research institutes in Sweden. SND is certified data repository and provides services for researchers to share and access research data from all research areas.
