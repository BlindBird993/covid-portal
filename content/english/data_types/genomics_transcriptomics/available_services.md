High-throughput sequencing enables us to monitor the evolution of SARS-Cov-2 during the pandemic, to identify genetic risk factors for a severe disease, to study the host response during infection, and much more.

At the SciLifeLab [National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI)](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/), we provide a wide range of sequencing technologies and can offer state-of-the-art solutions for many different types of Covid-19 sequencing projects.

Please visit our website [https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/contact/](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/contact/) to find out more about our services, and contact us at [support@ngisweden.se](mailto:support@ngisweden.se) to discuss your specific project.
