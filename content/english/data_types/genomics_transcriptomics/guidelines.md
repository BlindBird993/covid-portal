## Guidelines for COVID-19 data
Make your Covid-19 research data useful and accessible for the rest of the research community by publishing in a public repository together with descriptive metadata.

[NBIS](http://www.nbis.se/) can support you with Data Management Planning early on in the projects to make data sharing more efficient, both through [personal consultations](https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php?form=consultation) and by providing a [customised tool](https://dsw.scilifelab.se/) to create Data Management Plans. We can also assist you in identifying relevant repositories and common international standards for describing and publishing your data, as well as guide you through the submission process.
