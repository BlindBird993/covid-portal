Facilities which offer data generation services for imaging:

* [ALM](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/alm/) Advanced Light Microscopy facility give support with advanced fluorescence microscopy for nanoscale biological visualization using SIM, STED, STORM/PALM superresolution imaging. The facility also support single molecule spectroscopy measurement and analysis with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), as well as combined with superresolution dynamical studies (STED-FCS). Moreover, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy support allow users to image live and/or optically cleared larger samples. Submit your application at the NMI (National Microscopy Infrastructure) [project portal](https://nmi.scilifelab.se/).

* [Cryo-EM](https://cryoem.scilifelab.se/) offers access to state-of-the-art equipment and expertise in single particle cryo-EM and cryo-tomography (cryo-ET).

Facilities which offer data analysis services for imaging:

* [BioImage Informatics Facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/bioimage-informatics/) provides support and education in image analysis in order to help users get started with their own analysis.
