## Published Data

#### From Swedish research groups

* The [Human Protein Atlas (HPA)](https://www.proteinatlas.org)
  provides open access to protein expression data across human organs,
  tissues and cells. This protein resource is organized into focused
  sections for tissue expression, subcellular expression, proteins in
  the brain or in blood, proteins related to pathology and metabolic
  pathways.

* A special page of HPA has been dedicated to [human proteins and
  SARS-CoV-2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/sars-cov-2).

* [Nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) from SARS CoV-2 (PDB:6ZCT)](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6ZCT)  
  3D structure by x-ray diffraction.  
  Z.S. Fisher &amp; F. Kozielski,
  [European Spallation Source ERIC](https://europeanspallationsource.se/),
  Lund, Sweden.
